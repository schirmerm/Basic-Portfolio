        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>It all start in Seattle, WA 1994, which is where and when I was born. I was raised all around Seattle, but only actually lived there until I was in first grade. I always liked doing my own thing and being my own person, which is why I would get into a lot of trouble because I never really listened. I have always been a person that hopes for the best and plans for the worst. So my plans weren't always solid, but they were there just in case I needed a fall back plan. When I got to college I didn't really know what I wanted to do. I ended up majoring in busniess administration and economics. Not really what I had in mind, but I had a knack for it. I graduated as a double major, but I knew economics isn't what I wanted to do. What I do remember is in my last quarter I took an introductory computer science class and it was the most fun I had doing homework in all my years of school. After I was done with college I always knew I wanted to go back for coding so fast forward a couple of years and I find myself in California with an opportunity to learn coding. That opportunity happened to be UCI coding bootcamp, which brought me here. </p>
